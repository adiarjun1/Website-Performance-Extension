# Website-Performance-Extension
A lightweight Chrome extension that measures key web performance metrics: First Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, Cumulative Layout Shift, Time to First Byte, Total Load Time, DNS lookup time, total page size, HTTPS request count, page load time, and Time to Interactive. Metrics appear in an intuitive toolbar popup where you can click any value to get best-practice tips and system-design insights. Easily customize which metrics show via the settings page, and all data is stored locally with no external dependencies. If data isn't showing up at first, go to settings then go back to the home page.
